        September 19th, 1940, Warsaw, Poland; Witold Pilecki is captured by German forces, along with 2000 other Polish civilians, during a Warsaw street roundup. Unlike the other unlucky souls who were captured by Nazi forces that day, he volunteered to be there.

        Witold was born on May 13th, 1901 in the city of Olonets in the Russian Empire. Following the  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, Pilecki returned to Wilno, where he joined a paramilitary group known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Defence_of_Lithuania_and_Belarus_(1918)">Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defense Militia</a>. Wilno eventually fell to Bolshevik forces on January 5th, 1919, and Pilecki and his forces were forced to retreat to Bialystok.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        It was in Bialystok that Pilecki volunteered to join the newly formed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_Army_(Poland)" target="_blank">Polish Volunteer Army</a>. He fought in crucial battles during the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Soviet_War">Polish-Soviet War</a>, as part of a cavalry unit. Pilecki took part in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_offensive">Vilna Offensive</a>, where the Polish army were able to liberate Wilno and its surrounding area from the Red Army.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        In 1921, following the Polish–Soviet War, Pilecki was transferred to army reserves, promoted to the rank of corporal and designated as a non-commissioned officer. Later that year, he completed his secondary education and went on to start at the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius_University">Stefan Batory University</a>, but he was forced to abandon his studies in 1924, due to his father's declining health. Pilecki went on to complete his officer training at the Cavalry Reserve Officers' Training School. After his graduation, he was assigned to the 26th Lancer Regiment with the rank of ensign. By the end of 1926 he was promoted to second lieutenant.</p><br>
    <p>
        Pilecki spent much of time after the first World war, working as a community leader and activist. In 1932, he helped establish a Cavalry training school in Lida, and shortly after he was appointed commander of the 1st Lidsky Squadron. He held his position until 1937, when the unit was absorbed in the Polish 19th Infantry Division.

        On September 1st, 1939, Germany launched in invasion of Poland, marking the start of the Second World War. Pilecki was mobilized as a cavalry platoon commander and was assigned to the 19th Infantry Division. This unit fought heavily against German forces, but were ultimately defeated and forced to withdraw. After the units withdrawal, they were incorporated into the 41st Infantry Division, where Pilecki served as divisional second-in-command. After Warsaw was captured by German forces, Pilecki and his surviving men were forced to go into hiding.
    </p><br>
    <p> 
        While hiding from German forces, Pilecki and his commander formed the Secret Polish Army as a means to combat German rule.

        Up to 1940, very little was known about German concentration camps; many believed these camps were prison camps, or work camps. Very few realized these camps were actually death camps. It was also in 1940 that Pilecki proposed a plan to his superiors; to enter the German concentration camp of Auschwitz. His plan was to enter the camp, gather information and possibly help organize inmate resistance. Under the identity "Tomasz Serafiński", he allowed himself to be captured during a street roundup on September 19th, 1940. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Upon his arrival to Auschwitz, he was assigned to inmate number 4859. During his time in the camp, he formed the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Związek_Organizacji_Wojskowej">Związek Organizacji Wojskowej</a>, or ZOW, was the Auschwitz branch of the Polish Home Army. The ZOW focused gathering intelligence, preparing for a possible invasion on the camp by allied forces, and improving the morale of inmates by providing news from the outside, and distributing extra food and clothing. By 1942 ZOW had over 1000 members. The members of ZOW managed to build a radio that they used to broadcast information to allied forces. The Gestapo eventually had a successful campaign to find and kill several members of ZOW.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Pilecki decided that he needed to break out of the camp and personally convince the Home Army that an invasion and rescue effort on the camp was needed. On the night of April 26th, 1943, Pilecki was assigned to work in a camp bakery outside of the fence. He and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut a telephone line stole documents and fled.
